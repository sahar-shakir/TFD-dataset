Ten Fabrics Dataset - TFD
TFD is a textile fabric dataset for fabric inspection and defect detection. The dataset consists of ten types of textile fabrics that were obtained from a textile fabric factory, and therefore, ~90% of the defects in the dataset are real. Some additional defects such as holes and stains were manually added afterwards. The dataset has 27 different defect types in total.
Dataset was generated by scanning textile fabrics with a color scanner in a resolution of 300 dpi. Digitized fabric images are then partitioned into 256 x 256 pixels patches and stored in png format. During this partitioning, 10% overlapping were applied in order to avoid any defect remain around the image borders.
The dataset contains 3000 images where 2257 (75%) are clean and 743 (25%) are defected. All images are annotated in a resolution of 16x16 pixel blocks. Ground truths are provided as a text file that contains a binary matrix where every element represent a certain 16x16 block in the image. If a certain image region is defected, the corresponding block is denoted as 1; otherwise 0
